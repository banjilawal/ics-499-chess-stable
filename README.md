# About theis Version of ChessBot

This is the stable version of my ChessBot application.  I have had problems geting the Python builds to work I figured pushing the stable version to its own
branch would always work with no problems. This was only for the presentation.

# The More Interesting Production Version
I am continuing development on the Production version. ICS-499-chess-stable was forked from ChessBot repo (https://github.com/banjilawal/chessbot). You can 
always see where that is going.
